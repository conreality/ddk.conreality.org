This chapter explains where Conreality device drivers fit in with the rest
of the system and application layers.

Process Model
=============

**(To be written.)**

Execution Environment
=====================

Device drivers are executed by and as subprocesses of the Conreality daemon
(``conreald``), which provides the following execution environment for the
driver process:

* The process has three pre-opened file descriptors (0, 1, and 2), for the
  standard input, output, and error streams.

* The process's user and group privileges are adjusted (depending on
  configuration).

* The process's scheduling policy and priority are adjusted (depending on
  configuration).

* The process's CPU affinity mask is set so as to pin it to specific CPU
  cores (depending on configuration).

When executing drivers manually as standalone processes--in particular,
during driver development--it may be necessary to emulate some aspects of
this execution environment by using utilities such as :manpage:`su(1)`,
:manpage:`chrt(1)`, :manpage:`taskset(1)`, and :manpage:`nice(1)` when
executing the standalone driver process.

Signal Handling
---------------

It is the responsibility of the driver process to set up signal handlers and
correctly handle signals delivered by the kernel. The following
signal-handling behaviors are normative for driver processes:

* ``SIGHUP``: reload configuration.

* ``SIGINT``: exit the process.

* ``SIGPIPE``: exit the process.

* ``SIGTERM``: exit the process.

Command-Line Arguments
----------------------

Even though driver binaries are not intended to be directly executed by end
users, they should nonetheless implement standard command-line argument
processing so as to handle at least the following common options:

* ``-h``, ``--help``: show a help message and exit

* ``-q``, ``--quiet``: suppress superfluous output

* ``-v``, ``--verbose``: increase the verbosity level (could be given multiple times)

* ``-d``, ``--debug``: enable debugging output

Driver binaries may accept additional positional and/or optional arguments,
but must be able to execute using sane defaults when none are given.

Error Logging
-------------

Drivers must log any warnings and errors to the system log using
:manpage:`syslog(3)` interfaces. They may also log additional informational
messages and notices to the system log, using the appropriate lower priority
levels.

Logging should be configured with the program identification ``"conreality"``,
the option flags ``LOG_PID | LOG_CONS | LOG_NDELAY``, and the facility
``LOG_DAEMON``.

The log mask shall be set as follows:

* Default: ``LOG_NOTICE``

* ``-q``, ``--quiet``: ``LOG_WARNING``

* ``-v``, ``--verbose``: ``LOG_INFO``

* ``-d``, ``--debug``: ``LOG_DEBUG``

Exit Codes
----------

Driver processes must terminate using standard :manpage:`sysexits(3)` exit
codes, as per the following guidelines:

+------+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------+

Data Storage
============

Drivers must store their temporary runtime data (e.g., the current video
frame for a video capture device driver) under the ephemeral storage at
``/var/run/conreality`` (``/run/conreality`` on modern Linux distributions,
but ``/var/run`` is a symlink to ``/run`` so the difference is immaterial).
This directory hierarchy gets reset on system boot.

Any permanent data that should persist across reboots must be stored in a
driver-specific subdirectory under ``/var/lib/conreality``. The
subdirectory should be named after the driver class or driver name.
